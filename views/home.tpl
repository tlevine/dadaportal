<h1>Tom makes some emails public</h1>
<p>
  It's a lot easier for me to find things if they're
  on the public internet, and sometimes I don't even
  need to find things when they're there because other
  people find them for me. So please send email to
  <a href="mailto:Thomas Levine <public@thomaslevine.com>">public@thomaslevine.com</a>
  if it can be public. And keep using _@thomaslevine.com
  for emails that you don't want to be public.
</p>
<p>
  I think that making some emails public will make
  email easier for me and reduce my need for Facebook,
  Twitter, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
  It also turns out to be a pretty convenient way to
  put any old file on the internet; just send it as an
  <a href="/!/id:20140915182359.GA28330@tlevine_vm/">attachment</a>.
