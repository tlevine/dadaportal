Hi,

I found you on hackerspaces.org.

I have a nice touring bicycle that I don't want anymore,
as it's too much for me to deal with. You can read more here
about why it's too much for me, if you're curious.
http://thomaslevine.com/!/cycling/

It's a Surly Long Haul Trucker 56 cm with various accessories.
http://surlybikes.com/bikes/long_haul_trucker

Preferably, you also take the tools, camping gear, and bags.
(If you personally don't want everything, it would still be nice
if you took everything and found people to give it to later.)

Someone who likes cycling might still want it, though.

I'm in Bochum right now, but I'm happy to go to pretty much
anywhere that I can get to on S-Bahn.

I'm taking EuroNight 447 to Gdaǹsk tomorrow night, and I can
get on at Köln or any station east. Thus, I could easily meet
you at any of your hackerspaces. The exception is the Poznan
hackerspace; I'd have to meet you at train station, but I'll
tell you train details to make that easy.

If nobody tells me anything, I might just dump it in one of your
spaces and hope that somebody has a use for it, so please tell me
if you definitely don't want more junk.

Email is best way to reach me, but I have a phone too;
number is +31 6 49 039 181.

I can send a less frantic and more understandable email in a little bit.
I have not posted this in any of your IRC channels. In case I don't do
that, you might consider doing that. Here's a link that you might find
helpful: http://thomaslevine.com/@/id:20150418touringbike@calque/

Thanks

Tom
