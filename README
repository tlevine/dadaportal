Ejnug
===========
Publishing emails publically

Installing
-----------------
Installing this package is easy. ::

    pip install ejnug

(It works in Python 2.7 and 3.4.)

This doesn't set up the notmuch database, so you have to do that yourself.
You might use offlineimap to acquire your emails in a maildir, and then you
can configure notmuch to index that maildir.

Running
---------------------
Run this as the user that has the notmuch database configured. ::

    ejnug

This will create a web server on http://127.0.0.1:8081, and you can create
a proxy to that from Nginx or whatever if you want a prettier name.
