Dada Portal
===========
Door to the dada

There were several things that I wanted to do with static websites but
couldn't. Here I finally take the plunge and add them dynamically.

Running
--------------
Check it out.

Do stuff. ::

    ./manage.py collectstatic

Features
----------------
Headers on the website include

* Home
* Search
* Recent (mail and other)

Most data are stored in ordinary files with a YAML header and other
body, as I did when I used Nanoc.

Things can be categorized and otherwise related. These get stored in
a relational database or something, just because it would take a while
to load these from files.

I expose my public emails with an adapted version of ejnug. My "home"
computer gets the emails over imap and then sends the contents of the
"Public" mailboxes to my "nsa" computer over rsync, which indexes them
in notmuch. The dada portal hosts the notmuch-indexed emails.

I do my own tracking so I don't need to use Piwik and so I don't have
to match different logs after the fact.

My schedule gets rendered to HTML (with pal) and hosted.

Source code is easy to display. ``/source`` is a directory listing of
the top-level of the repository, and directories recursively list their
contents.

The following markup languages for articles are supported.

* Restructured Text
* Markdown
* Hypertext Markup Language

Public and semi-public articles are a git submodule.

Articles are automatically converted into
`big <https://github.com/tmcw/big>`_ presentations.

Homepage displays the most popular articles, maybe grouped in some
interesting way, or maybe not if that's easier.

Maybe features
------------------
I want some sort of search. Omega seems the simplest, but I couldn't get
it working. Maybe I just add everything to notmuch. Actually, *that* is
the simplest.

Not features
----------------
I don't do forms in here; I run LimeSurvey and put forms there.

People can't edit my site anymore, as they could with Branchable.
But nobody used it anyway. If people really want it, I can put the
articles submodule up somewhere.
